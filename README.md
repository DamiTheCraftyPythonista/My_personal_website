My personal website

Hello! Welcome to my personal website. It was created to introduce myself, an aspiring software developer. On the website, which is accessible online through <a href='https://my-personal-website-1.onrender.com/'>THIS<a>
link, I provide some information about myself, links to my projects and to my social media. You can also contact me directly through the website. 

The core of the website is coded in Python and built in Flask template. It also uses JavaScript to achieve some functionality. If you want to download the code and run it please note that it is necessary to
provide environmental variables, at minimum 'WTFORMS_SECRET_KEY', to make the send_mail() function also valid and properly set 'EMAIL' and 'EMAIL_PASSWORD'.
